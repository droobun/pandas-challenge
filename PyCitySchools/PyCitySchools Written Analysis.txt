PyCitySchools_ Analysis:The first analysis that struck at me was the disparity in Overall Passing % between Charter and District Schools. Charter schools had a staggering 90.4% Overall Passing %, while District Schools had a disappointing 53.6% Overall Passing %.The second, and potentially even more staggering conclusion that came from the data, was the Overall Passing % based on School Spending. You would think that the more a school spent on a student, the better the student would do in regards to passing or failing both reading and math classes. Unfortunately, the highest spend range per student ($645-680), resulted in the lowest Overall Passing %, totaling at 53.53%.
